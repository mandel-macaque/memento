## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- git-memento-workflow: Use git-memento to initialize repository-level AI provider settings, create commits that attach AI session transcripts as git notes, and sync notes to remote. Trigger this skill when users ask to create or troubleshoot memento commits, configure providers (Codex or Claude), verify note attachment, or share notes with team remotes. (file: /Users/mandel/.codex/skills/git-memento-workflow/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mandel/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mandel/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

### Manuel de la Pena

The github action to publish the release on macos has the following error: The configuration 'macos-13-us-default' is not supported

Fix the action so that we can have a release for mac os

### Codex

I’ll inspect the release workflow configuration to find where `macos-13-us-default` is set, then patch it to a supported macOS runner configuration and validate the workflow syntax.

### Codex

I found the release workflow; next I’ll open `.github/workflows/release.yml` and adjust the macOS matrix entry to remove the unsupported configuration.

### Codex

I confirmed the issue is coming from the `macos-13` runner entry in the release matrix. I’m patching it to a currently supported Intel macOS label so `osx-x64` can still be produced.

### Codex

Updated the release workflow to use a supported Intel macOS runner for the x64 build:

- Changed `os: macos-13` to `os: macos-15-intel` in [release.yml](/Users/mandel/Work/memento/.github/workflows/release.yml:26)

This keeps your matrix behavior the same (`osx-arm64` on `macos-latest`, `osx-x64` on Intel macOS) while avoiding the unsupported `macos-13-us-default` configuration error.

Next step: re-run the `release` workflow (or trigger `ci` on `main`) and confirm the macOS publish job succeeds.

### Manuel de la Pena

Will this work for arm (M chips). We do not want to use rosetta for this tool

### Codex

Good call to verify. The produced binary is already `osx-arm64` (native Apple Silicon), but I’ll pin the arm build runner from `macos-latest` to an explicit arm label so it stays unambiguous over time.

### Codex

Yes. Your release matrix now builds a native Apple Silicon binary:

- `rid: osx-arm64` on `os: macos-15` (native arm runner)
- `rid: osx-x64` on `os: macos-15-intel` (Intel runner)

That means M-chip users get `git-memento-osx-arm64.tar.gz`, which runs without Rosetta.

Updated file: [release.yml](/Users/mandel/Work/memento/.github/workflows/release.yml:23)

### Manuel de la Pena

Using the $git-memento-workflow create a new commit with a one liner title and a longer commit message explaining the change. Then push to origin and sync the notes

name: git-memento-workflow
description: Use git-memento to initialize repository-level AI provider settings, create commits that attach AI session transcripts as git notes, and sync notes to remote. Trigger this skill when users ask to create or troubleshoot memento commits, configure providers (Codex or Claude), verify note attachment, or share notes with team remotes.
---

# Git Memento Workflow

Run this workflow whenever work must be committed with an AI session note.

## 1. Preflight

- Confirm repository status with `git status --short` and branch with `git branch --show-current`.
- Confirm `git memento` is available: `git memento help`.
- If unavailable, install `git-memento` into a directory on `PATH` and re-check.

## 2. Initialize Once Per Repository

- Check configuration: `git config --local --get memento.provider`.
- If missing, run `git memento init codex` or `git memento init claude`.
- If provider CLI shape differs from expected `sessions get/list --json`, configure adapter command in local git config:
- `git config --local memento.<provider>.bin <adapter-or-cli-path>`
- `git config --local memento.<provider>.getArgs '<args with {id} placeholder>'`
- `git config --local memento.<provider>.listArgs '<list args>'`

## 3. Resolve Session ID

- Prefer explicit session id from the user.
- For Codex in this environment, default to `CODEX_THREAD_ID` when present.
- Validate retrieval before commit by running provider command manually if needed.

## 4. Create Memento Commit

- Stage files as needed (`git add ...`).
- Run commit through memento so note attachment happens in the same flow:
- `git memento commit <session-id> -m "<subject>"`
- For longer body, use embedded newlines in `-m` or omit `-m` to use editor.

## 5. Verify Note Attachment

- Read latest commit: `git log -1 --pretty=fuller`.
- Show note on that commit: `git notes show <commit-hash>`.
- If note is missing, inspect provider command config and rerun commit flow after fixing.

## 6. Push Code and Sync Notes

- Push commit branch: `git push <remote> <branch>`.
- Sync notes with memento: `git memento share-notes <remote>`.
- Verify notes exist remotely: `git ls-remote <remote> 'refs/notes/*'`.

## 7. Failure Handling Checklist

- `git-memento is not configured`: run `git memento init ...`.
- Provider command fails: verify `memento.<provider>.*` git config and executable permissions.
- Session not found: list sessions using provider list command and retry with exact id.
- Note push missing on remote: rerun `git memento share-notes <remote>` and confirm remote ref output.

</skill>

### Codex

Using the `git-memento-workflow` skill now to create a memento-backed commit, then push and sync notes. I’ll run preflight checks first (status, branch, memento availability, provider config, and session id).

### Codex

Preflight is clean: provider is configured as `codex`, `CODEX_THREAD_ID` is available, and only the release workflow file is modified. I’ll stage that file and create a memento commit with a one-line subject plus a detailed body.

### Manuel de la Pena

<turn_aborted>
The user interrupted the previous turn on purpose. Any running unified exec processes were terminated. If any tools/commands were aborted, they may have partially executed; verify current state before retrying.
</turn_aborted>

### Manuel de la Pena

Be careful, memento write now seems to have a bug in which you cannot pass -m twice to create a onew liner and the commit. Try againg but make sure we handle the commit correctly. Make sure that no `\n` are shown in the commit, they should be new lines

### Codex

Understood. I’ll verify repository state first, then create the memento commit using a single `-m` with real embedded newlines so the message formats correctly.

### Codex

No partial commit was created; only `.github/workflows/release.yml` is modified. I’m now staging and committing with `git memento commit` using one `-m` value containing actual newlines.
