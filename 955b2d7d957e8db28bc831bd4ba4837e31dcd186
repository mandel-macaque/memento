- Provider: Codex

<INSTRUCTIONS>
## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- git-memento-workflow: Use git-memento to initialize repository-level AI provider settings, create commits that attach AI session transcripts as git notes, and sync notes to remote. Trigger this skill when users ask to create or troubleshoot memento commits, configure providers (Codex or Claude), verify note attachment, or share notes with team remotes. (file: /Users/mandel/.codex/skills/git-memento-workflow/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mandel/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mandel/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

### Manuel de la Pena

In our last session we have the following comment from the last commit you made:

One caveat: despite passing two -m flags, the resulting commit message was recorded as a single long line (no
separate subject/body split). If you want, I can do a follow-up to correct that behavior in git memento commit
parsing.

Fix the parsing issue. Use the $git-memento-workflow to create a new commit with a one liner title and a longer commit. Then push to origin and sync the notes

# Git Memento Workflow

Run this workflow whenever work must be committed with an AI session note.

## 1. Preflight

- Confirm repository status with `git status --short` and branch with `git branch --show-current`.
- Confirm `git memento` is available: `git memento help`.
- If unavailable, install `git-memento` into a directory on `PATH` and re-check.

## 2. Initialize Once Per Repository

- Check configuration: `git config --local --get memento.provider`.
- If missing, run `git memento init codex` or `git memento init claude`.
- If provider CLI shape differs from expected `sessions get/list --json`, configure adapter command in local git config:
- `git config --local memento.<provider>.bin <adapter-or-cli-path>`
- `git config --local memento.<provider>.getArgs '<args with {id} placeholder>'`
- `git config --local memento.<provider>.listArgs '<list args>'`

## 3. Resolve Session ID

- Prefer explicit session id from the user.
- For Codex in this environment, default to `CODEX_THREAD_ID` when present.
- Validate retrieval before commit by running provider command manually if needed.

## 4. Create Memento Commit

- Stage files as needed (`git add ...`).
- Run commit through memento so note attachment happens in the same flow:
- `git memento commit <session-id> -m "<subject>"`
- For longer body, use embedded newlines in `-m` or omit `-m` to use editor.

## 5. Verify Note Attachment

- Read latest commit: `git log -1 --pretty=fuller`.
- Show note on that commit: `git notes show <commit-hash>`.
- If note is missing, inspect provider command config and rerun commit flow after fixing.

## 6. Push Code and Sync Notes

- Push commit branch: `git push <remote> <branch>`.
- Sync notes with memento: `git memento share-notes <remote>`.
- Verify notes exist remotely: `git ls-remote <remote> 'refs/notes/*'`.

## 7. Failure Handling Checklist

- `git-memento is not configured`: run `git memento init ...`.
- Provider command fails: verify `memento.<provider>.*` git config and executable permissions.
- Session not found: list sessions using provider list command and retry with exact id.
- Note push missing on remote: rerun `git memento share-notes <remote>` and confirm remote ref output.

### Codex

Using the `git-memento-workflow` skill for this turn since you asked for a memento commit, push, and notes sync. I’ll first inspect repo state and locate the commit message parsing path to implement the fix before committing through `git memento`.

### Codex

I found the parser and commit wiring files; next I’m reading `CliArgs` and commit execution code to pinpoint why two `-m` values ended up as one line in the actual git commit.

### Codex

The parser and `GitService.CommitAsync` look mostly correct at first glance, so I’m checking `CommitWorkflow` and command runner argument handling next, because this issue is likely happening when argument lists are transformed into a process command string.

### Codex

I hit a wrong path for the command runner file, so I’m locating the actual implementation now to verify how arguments are passed to `git commit`.

### Codex

I’m going to inspect the latest commit message and the parser tests side by side to reproduce the exact failure mode from your prior session, then I’ll patch with a regression test before creating the new memento commit.

### Codex

I confirmed the last commit really landed as a single paragraph. I’m running the test suite now to see whether there’s an existing failing case around `-m` parsing that we can pin and fix with a regression.

### Codex

I’m inspecting the git note attached to the last commit to recover the exact command syntax used in that session; that should tell us which parser path actually misbehaved.

### Codex

I’m implementing a concrete parser fix now: make `-m`/message parsing preserve raw message text instead of trimming it, and add explicit support for standard `--message` forms with regression tests. Then I’ll run tests and proceed with the memento commit flow.

### Codex

I’ve patched parser behavior and added regression tests. I’m running the .NET tests now, then I’ll stage and commit through `git memento` with a one-line subject plus longer body.

### Codex

Tests are passing (16 total). Next I’m running workflow preflight/config checks, grabbing the current session id from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, and then I’ll create the memento commit.

### Codex

Preflight is good (`memento.provider=codex`, current session id is set). I’m staging the two modified files and creating the new commit via `git memento commit` with a one-line title plus a longer body paragraph.

### Codex

The commit was blocked by sandbox write restrictions on `.git/index.lock`; I’m rerunning the same staging and memento commit command with elevated permissions so the commit can be created.

### Codex

The shell interpreted backticks in the commit body as command substitution, so I’m rerunning the commit with safely quoted message text.
